//chatbase.coüí¨
Chatbase.co is a no-code AI chatbot builder that lets you train your own chatbot using documents like .txt, .pdf, websites, or knowledge bases ‚Äî and integrates GPT models like ChatGPT-3.5 or 4.0 to power the chatbot‚Äôs intelligence.
 How Chatbase.co Works (Internally - Simplified)
Upload Knowledge Base
 You upload a file (like your knowledge.txt) ‚Üí Chatbase extracts and stores the content.
Text Chunking + Embedding
 Your content is broken into small "chunks" ‚Üí then converted into vector embeddings using a model like OpenAI's embedding API.
Vector Database Storage
 These vectors are stored in a vector DB (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or built-in DB) so it can search semantically later.
User Sends a Query
 When someone types a question, it converts the query to a vector and semantically searches the vector database for the most relevant content chunks.
Prompt Construction
 It takes the found chunks and injects them into a prompt ‚Üí sends this to a GPT model (you choose: GPT-3.5, 4.0, etc.).
Response Generation
 The selected GPT model generates a response, grounded in your uploaded knowledge ‚Üí and sends it back to the chat UI.
UI & Customization - The chatbot UI is embeddable into your website. You can customize the appearance, system prompt, behavior, etc.
